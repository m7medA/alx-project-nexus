# ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering — Project Nexus

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a documentation hub for the major learnings and outcomes of the **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**. It showcases a complete understanding of frontend technologies, best practices, and the ability to collaborate effectively with backend teams to deliver real-world applications.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Consolidate key concepts and tools learned during the ProDev program.
- Document real-world challenges and their implemented solutions.
- Serve as a future reference guide for other learners and myself.
- Demonstrate proficiency in full-stack collaboration with backend engineers.

## 💡 Final Project: E-Commerce Web Application

As a culmination of the program, I built a fully functional **E-Commerce web application** using modern frontend technologies. The application allows users to browse products, view details, manage a shopping cart, and authenticate via a login system.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Next.js** – For building scalable and performant React applications with file-based routing.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – For rapid and responsive UI development with utility-first styling.  
- **TypeScript** – To enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer experience.  
- **Redux Toolkit** – For managing global application state in a predictable manner.  
- **GraphQL & REST API Integration** – For dynamic data interaction from backend services.  
- **Supabase** – Used as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) to build and manage the database, and integrated with the API layer for authentication and data persistence.  
- **System Design Principles** – To build maintainable and scalable architecture.

## ⚙️ Collaboration

Although I built this project individually, I collaborated with backend developers by integrating real API endpoints.  
Additionally, I built and managed a full database using **Supabase**, and integrated it with my frontend through Supabase’s API layer for authentication and data operations.
