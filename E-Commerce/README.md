# E-Commerce React Project

## About This Project

This project was developed as part of my final project at **ALX Nexus**. It is a modern E-Commerce web application that allows users to browse products, view best sellers, manage their shopping cart, and handle user authentication. The project demonstrates my skills in building scalable, maintainable, and responsive web applications using the latest front-end technologies.

> **Note:** I will still work on this project to enhance it further, add new features, and improve the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces and managing component state.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient and scalable state management.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and responsive UI styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For modern and scalable icons.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For application logic and interactivity.

## Redux State Management

Redux Toolkit is used to manage the global state of the application in a predictable and scalable way. The main slices and their responsibilities are:

- **Auth Slice (`loginSlice`)**:  
  Handles user authentication state, login/logout actions, and persists authentication status using `localStorage`.

- **Cart Slice**:  
  Manages the shopping cart, including adding, removing, and updating products in the cart, as well as calculating totals.

- **Products Slice**:  
  Fetches and stores product data, manages pagination, filtering, and best sellers.

Redux allows different parts of the app to access and update shared state easily, making the app more maintainable and testable.

- **Product Details**: View detailed information and images for each product.
- **User Authentication**: Login and logout functionality with persistent authentication state.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and view products in the cart.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
